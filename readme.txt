The [LSX Search Extension](https://lsx.lsdev.biz/extensions/lsx-search/) intergrates with the FacetWP plugin to allow for superbly filtered search results for your users. 

Allow your users to break down their search results using available filters (a.k.a "Facets"). These are created by the FacetWP plugin, and with the power of LSX Search - we bring these filters to the search results. 

The [LSX Search Extension](https://lsx.lsdev.biz/extensions/lsx-search/) allows you to choose which type of content will be filtered in your global search results, and choose the display of the results.
